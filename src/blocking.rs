//! A blocking client, for code that is not async. Enabled by the `blocking` feature.
//!
//! Every call runs on a runtime this client owns, so it cannot be used from
//! inside an async runtime: that would block the thread driving it. Calls from
//! an async context fail with [`Error::Config`] rather than panicking, which is
//! what the underlying runtime would do.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # fn main() -> kunobi_jev::Result<()> {
//! use kunobi_jev::blocking::Client;
//! use kunobi_jev::{Questions, SystemOneRequest, noul};
//!
//! let client = Client::new()?;
//! let mut questions = Questions::new();
//! let billing = questions.add("billing", noul("Is this about billing?"));
//!
//! let result = client.system_one(SystemOneRequest::new("I was charged twice.", questions))?;
//! println!("{}", result.answer(&billing)?.noul);
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
